# Google Service Wrapper

Google service wrapper helps to understand about how you can authorise google service and get the google client to perform any google service operations like gdrive, sheets etc.

I have implemented the drive service wrapper with some examples like you can search all files from your all drives (included teamdrives).

I have also created an example directory where you can see the sample implementation of this wrapper.


## How to get this wrapper

```bash
go get github.com/lokesh-go/google-services/src
```
